Audio reactive visualisation for the Whitestone contest, featuring music by Mike Gao.

[Clubber.js](https://github.com/wizgrav/clubber) was used for the audio reactive parts and Three.JS + AFrame as a boilerplate.

Features vertex deformation with some fake ao and analytic area lighting for the meshes.
